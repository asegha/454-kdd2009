## Synopsis
Code repository for predict 454 team project. The task is to build predictive models for the 2009 kdd cup using the small data set. Since the competition is over and entries are no longer being scored, we had to carve out our own data set from the training data to score our results on. Also we were tasked to use the small data set and the publicly available scores I can find are from the large data set, so it makes it hard to guage performance. The code lives in my github account, but a large portion of it was written by my team who are not git users. Most of the files have the names of the author in the file name.
